  <p>Founded in 2019, the Originally From Ohio Dynasty League began as a means for many to embark on their first journey into the chasms of building their very own dynasty football franchise. Each year, managers compete to have their names etched in immortal stone as Champions, aiming to avoid the ever-humiliating Toilet Bowl.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams, while others began the slow process of building their dream juggernaut dynasty team. Over the years it has become clear that a portion of the league prioritizes youth and draft picks, while the rest gravitate towards the steadfast value of veterans. While some managers have fled from injuries and tumultuous contract negotiations, others bought the dip and built for their future.</p>
  <p>After years of domination, struggle and humiliation some have been fired to more simpler re-draft leagues, where others have decided to retire whilst at the pinnacle. Nonetheless the league has only gotten stronger. With more passionate managers, the competition has become more intense and more difficult than ever before.</p>
  <p>Recently there have been massive moves that have shaken the very foundation of the league. With the two time league champ retired, and league activity at an all-time high there is room for a new dynasty to begin.</p>
  <p>Coming off of a season where the sixth seeded Kyle Clark went into his first playoff appearance only to go on and win his first Championship, there have been a plethora of massive trades, moves and acquisitions that leave this upcoming season to chance...</p>

From lob-sided trades like the infamous "Kelce-Godwin trade" to misguided draft selections like Jalen Raegor, this team's history has it all.</p>
        <p>However, a stroke of fortune shed it's light when this franchise decided to trade a haul of future draft choices for the #1 draft selection in the 2021 draft. Being a Bengals fan, the selection of Ja'Marr Chase was an easy one, but he did not have the faintest clue for what Chase would eventually become.</p>
        <p>Seen by many now as the #1 overall dynasty asset alongside fellow LSU Tiger, Justin Jefferson, this stroke of good luck seemed to be the beginning of a new era. In the following two drafts, The Ja'Mazing Chase would go on to select three wide receivers that would shape out a promising young core that is amongst the best in the league with Chris Olave, George Pickens and now rookie Jaxon Smith-Njigba.</p>
        <p>To compliment this young core, The Ja'Mazing Chase has made a trio of massive moves to acquire the necessary Running Back stable to compete with the best of the best. These moves overall resulted trading three first round draft selections in 2023, 2024 and 2025 for Running Backs Najee Harris, Nick Chubb and Austin Ekeler with one of those trades being the leagues very first four-team trade...</p>
        <p>While these moves have firmly placed this team in a win-now mode, the hardest part of the journey has yet to come as this season unlike any other has seen an arms-race, akin to the AFC, where the top of the top teams have been accumulating talent left and right.</p>
